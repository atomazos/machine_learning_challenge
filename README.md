## *Exoplanet Exploration*

Over a period of almost 10 years in the deep state - I mean deep space - the NASA Kepler space telescope has been deployed on a planet-hunting mission to discover exoplanets, which are hidden planets outside of our solar system.

I created two machine learning models capable of classifying candidate *exoplanets* from the raw exoplanets dataset that can be accessed at the link below. 

With the help of the sci-kit learning flowchart (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) to choose the right estimator for this problem, I determined the most appropriate ones were the Ensemble Classifiers. Accordingly, I chose the ExtraTree and RandomForest Classifiers to model the relationship between the features and label of the dataset.
