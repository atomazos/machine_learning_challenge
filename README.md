## *Exoplanet Exploration*

I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate *exoplanets* from the raw dataset contained in the the exoplanet_data csv file. Over a period of 9 years in the deep state, I mean deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been deployed on a planet-hunting mission to discover exoplanets - that is, hidden planets outside of our solar system.
